    <h1>Fonts and font availability</h1>

    <p>The text on the cover page has to be set in fonts supporting all the scripts
    used in COP, which is fairly large and includes Latin/Western
    European, Cyrillic, Greek, Chinese, Arabic and Hebrew.</p>

    <p>Running the <a href="sheet_test.sh">sheet_test.sh</a>, will execute a
    java class that dumps the names of all available fonts.</p>

    <h2>1. Commercial fonts</h2>

    <p>There are fonts available for the purpose, like Arial Unicode MS and Lucida
    Sans Unicode, both of which are available as commercial software from
    Microsoft. </p>

    <p>Here is a book containing text in Arabic script. Everything in Arial Unicode:</p>

    <a href="http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test/object61539.en.pdf">http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test/object61539.en.pdf</a>

    <h2>2. Multiple fonts, open source</h2>

    <p>There are also quite a few other solutions that require the use of multiple
    fonts depending upon language. This is the same one is using a font family
    DejaVue, which is open source</p>

    <a href="http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/dejavue_arabic.pdf">http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/dejavue_arabic.pdf</a>

    <p>However, with Chinese, we have to add another font</p>

    <a href="http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/dejavue_grf_chi_chinese.pdf">http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/dejavue_grf_chi_chinese.pdf</a>

    <p>Here we are using two fonts. Both of which are open source, so there is no
    cost for fonts but I had to correct the document since the language of the
    title was incorrectly set to Danish.</p>

    <h2>3. Singel OSS font</h2>

    <p>I've found a fairly complete font which is said to be GPL. It should in
    principle be able to do it all.</p>

    <a href="http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/Code2000_chinese.pdf">http://code-01.kb.dk/svn/cop-pdf/trunk/test-oss-fonts/Code2000_chinese.pdf</a>

    <p>Problem is that it is written by a mr James Kass as shareware software. The
    price is set to USD 5 but the author disappeared from the Internet 2010 and
    since then it isn't known how to use Code2000 legally.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion and recommendation</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>I don't know if we can legally embed Arial Unicode MS, acquired as a part of MS
      Office, in PDFs published in Denmark in an electronic publishing system. If we
      can, that is the easisest solution. Obviously, we can pay the license fee. See <br/>

      </li>
      <li>
	Is the one I'd recommend, if there hadn't been problems with language tags
	for our metadata. I like the DejaVue-font and it is free.
      </li>

      <li>Just don't know. A governmental organization cannot really use things
      without a proper licence.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I recommend alternative 1.</p>
